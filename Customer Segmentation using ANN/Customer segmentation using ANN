A bank has collected some data from it's customers and want to predict the chances of the customers leaving the bank based on the collected data.
The task of the machine learning scientist is to build a model to predict the probability of a customer leaving the bank.
We use ANN to predict the outcome. The ANN has two hidden layers one of which uses the rectifier function as the activation function , and the other layer uses the sigmoid function .
This folder contains  a dataset to train the ANN and a jupyter notebook implementing the model to solve the problem.
