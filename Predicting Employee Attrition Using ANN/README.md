# Predicting Employee Attrition Using ANN

Understanding the people that work in the company is one of the most important aspects that makes a company successful.This folder contains a deep learning approach to understanding the problem of employee attrition.<br>Why does it happen ? What are some factors contributing to it ? Are there any interesting patterns or behaviours that can be observed ?

Here we apply our knowledge of ANNs to design a model that can efffectively predict which employees are going to leave a job and which are going to stay . In doing so , we understand which factors are good indicators of employee attrition and also  what is the relation between different factors.

Some of the other things that we explore in the jupyter notebook are:
* KDEplots
* Correlation heatmaps
* Oversampling (ADASYN)
* Configuring our Neural Net
* Stratified K-fold cross validation
* SHAP values and summary plot

The dataset used in the above problem can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset
