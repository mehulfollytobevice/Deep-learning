# Predicting Cryptocurrency prices using RNN

This folder contains an implementation of RNN to predict prices of cryptocurrency using time-series data .The implementation is very basic
and can be full of bugs but successfully represents an implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network.

The price of a particular currency in the future is predicted using the volume and the close prices of the currencies in the present .
The currency used for the prediction are:<br>
1.Bitcoin<br>
2.Litecoin<br>
3.Etherium<br>
