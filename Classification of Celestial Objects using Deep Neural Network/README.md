# Classification of celestial objects using Deep Neural Networks 
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has created the most detailed three-dimensional maps of the Universe ever made, with deep multi-color images of one-third of the sky, and spectra for more than three million astronomical objects. It allows to learn and explore all phases and surveys - past, present, and future - of the SDSS.

The dataset consists of 10,000 observations of space taken by the SDSS. Every observation is described by 17 feature columns and 1 class column which identifies it to be either a star, galaxy or quasar.The dataset can be found here:https://www.kaggle.com/lucidlenn/sloan-digital-sky-survey

This folder contains an ipython notebook showing the implementation of the DNN . The Neural Network implemented in the notebook can be improved further and trained for a longer number of epochs so that the training loss and validation loss decreases further.

They really have a huge database which offers the possibility of creating all kinds of tables with respect to personal interests.
